# No Google Link Shenanigans
Prevents / reverts link rewriting on Google pages

Requires greasemonkey/tampermonkey (or equivalent system for running JS userscripts).

# Installing
The easiest way is (there's gotta be a better way to do this):
  1. Copy the [whole JS file](https://github.com/phoglenix/no-google-link-shenanigans/raw/master/no-google-link-shenanigans.js) to your clipboard
  1. Create a new userscript
  1. Click "Use Script from Clipboard" (at least that's what it's called in Greasemonkey)
or paste the script in the text editor that appears for script editing
  1. Done
